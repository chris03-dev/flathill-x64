This is an amateur hobby project about a compiler for "flathill".

"flathill" (FASM-based High Level Language) is a programming language with a focus on minimal data typing, and granular control of low-level concepts. It aims to be compatible with the C-style x64 [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=vs-2019) and [Linux](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/10au/sections/Section1_recap.pdf) calling conventions. Its compiler is built with C++, and its output is used as assembly input for [flat assembler](www.flatassembler.net).

Its compiler is currently in a very early stage, so it should NOT be considered a real development tool as of yet.
